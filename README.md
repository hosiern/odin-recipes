# odin-recipes

Working on practicing HTML skills, build a basic recipe website. Reflection upon website completion to follow.

Completed project per instructions on The Odin Project with a few visual tweaks. More of a refresher project to get me back
into coding, I elected to add my own flair to the assigned pages:

-Added line breaks in areas that made sense based on VSCode line breaks

-Utilized Emmet shorcuts to create elements, where appropriate (ie. ul>li\*10, etc)

Learning to make it a point to commit to GIT often and after as few changes as possible to keep commit messages within the
recommended 50 character limit. Created a commit template for longer commit messages, but intend to use only when absolutely
necessary.
