    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are
        cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).<br />
        Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps
        to brown the chicken).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the
        bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a
        clean dish towel or waxed paper. <br />
        LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with
        vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken
        in HOT oil on both sides.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
        (the chicken will be <br />
        cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and
        continue to fry until crispy.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken
        you have, you may <br />
        have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly
        warm oven while preparing the rest.
      </li>
