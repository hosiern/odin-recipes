    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large baking
        <br />
        sheet.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Fill a large bowl with cold water, add the potatoes, and allow to soak
        <br />
        for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Whisk together the oil, vegetable juice cocktail, chili powder, ground
        <br />
        cumin, onion granules, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, sugar, and salt in
        <br />
        a large bowl. Drain the potatoes, and pat dry with paper towels. Toss
        <br />
        the potatoes with the oil and spice mixture; stir until evenly coated.
        <br />
        Arrange fries in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
