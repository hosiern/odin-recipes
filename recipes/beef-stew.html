    <br />
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Toss the beef, flour, and salt in a sealable bag until the beef is
        coated.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine the beef
        <br />
        and Worcestershire sauce in the skillet; cook until the beef is evenly
        <br />
        browned on all sides; transfer to a slow cooker, but do not clean the
        <br />
        skillet. Add the carrots, potatoes, parsley, and pepper to the slow
        <br />
        cooker.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Combine the boiling water and soup mix in a small bowl; add to slow
        cooker.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion and
        <br />
        garlic in the melted butter until soft; transfer the onion and garlic to
        <br />
        the slow cooker and return the skillet to the heat. Combine the wine and
        <br />
        mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the mushrooms begin to absorb the
        <br />
        wine; pour the mixture into the slow cooker.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place the cover on the slow cooker and set to High; cook for one hour.
        <br />
        Reduce heat to Low and cook until the beef is fork-tender, 6 to 8 hours.
        <br />
        Whisk together the warm water and cornstarch; stir into the stew; cook
        <br />
        uncovered until stew thickens, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
